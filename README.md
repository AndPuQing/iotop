# iotop - Rust Implementation

A Rust implementation of iotop, a tool to monitor I/O usage of processes on Linux.

### Architecture

The implementation is structured into several modules:

- **main.rs**: Entry point, command-line parsing, and main loop orchestration
- **taskstats.rs**: Netlink communication with kernel for taskstats (currently simplified)
- **process.rs**: Process and thread information management, /proc filesystem reading
- **ui.rs**: Terminal UI rendering with crossterm, formatting utilities

### Key Differences from Python Version

1. **Language**: Rust instead of Python 2/3
2. **UI Library**: crossterm instead of curses
3. **Performance**: Compiled binary, should be faster and use less memory
4. **Safety**: Memory-safe with Rust's ownership system

### Usage

Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

Run interactively (requires root for netlink access):
```bash
sudo cargo run --release
```

Run in batch mode:
```bash
sudo cargo run --release -- -b -n 5
```

Show only active processes:
```bash
sudo cargo run --release -- -o
```

Show help:
```bash
cargo run -- --help
```

### Options

```
-o, --only               Only show processes or threads actually doing I/O
-P, --processes          Show processes, not all threads
-a, --accumulated        Show accumulated I/O instead of bandwidth
-d, --delay <DELAY>      Delay between iterations in seconds [default: 1.0]
-n, --iter <ITERATIONS>  Number of iterations before ending (infinite if not specified)
-b, --batch              Batch mode (non-interactive)
```

### Known Limitations

1. **Missing I/O priority support**: The original Python version supports viewing and setting I/O priorities via ioprio syscalls. This is not yet implemented.

2. **Limited vmstat integration**: The original tracks current vs total I/O from /proc/vmstat. This needs to be added.

3. **Thread name detection**: Some edge cases in thread name display may differ from the Python version.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Complete netlink implementation**: Properly implement the netlink generic protocol to communicate with the kernel's taskstats interface
2. **I/O priority support**: Add ioprio syscall wrappers for viewing/setting process I/O priorities
3. **vmstat integration**: Track actual disk I/O vs process I/O accounting
4. **Performance optimization**: Profile and optimize hot paths
5. **Additional filters**: Support for filtering by PID, user, etc.
6. **Export modes**: JSON, CSV output formats

### Development

The project uses standard Rust tooling:

```bash
# Build
cargo build

# Run tests (when added)
cargo test

# Check for issues
cargo clippy

# Format code
cargo fmt
```
